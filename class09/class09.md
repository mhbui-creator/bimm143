## Background

Today we are taking a detor to analyze a fun dataset (that we have more
intrinsic insight into) with the most useful analysis method we have
learned thus for - Principal Compenent Analysis (PCA)

## Data Import

The data is all related to halloween candy and is from the 538 website.

``` r
candy <- read.csv ("candy-data.txt", row.names = 1)
head(candy)
```

There is a useful `skim()` function in the **skimr** package that can
help give you a quick overview of a given dataset. Let’s install this
package and try it on our candy data.

``` r
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```

``` r
# The skim() function provides a summary of the dataset by grouping variables 
# based on their data type. 

# skim(candy) scans through the dataset and organizes the output by variable 
# type.
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale
> to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Yes, the winpercent variable is on a different scale in comparison to
the majority of other columns. Even though most variables are binary 0
or 1, winpercent is a continuous variable representing a percentage.
Additionally, the values range from 0 to 100.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the
> candy\$chocolate column?

In the candy\$chocolate column, a value of 1 indicates that the candy
contains chocolate, while a value of 0 indicates that it does not.

## Exploratory Analysis

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values using both base R and
> ggplot2.

``` r
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

![](class09_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20)
```

![](class09_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No, the distribution of the winpercent values skew to the right.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

``` r
mean(candy$winpercent)
```

    [1] 50.31676

``` r
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

       Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
      22.45   39.14   47.83   50.32   59.86   84.18 

The center of the distribution is below 50% since the median winpercent
is 47.83%. Even though the mean is slightly above 50%, the median better
represents the center because the distribution is slightly skewed.

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit
> candy?

``` r
choc.ind <- as.logical(candy$chocolate)
choc.candy <- candy[choc.ind,]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
choc.win
```

    [33] 43.06890 45.73675 49.65350 81.64291 49.52411

``` r
mean(choc.win)
```

    [1] 60.92153

``` r
fruit.ind <- as.logical(candy$fruity)
# converts the chocolate column into True/False values
fruit.candy <- candy[fruit.ind,]
# subsets the dataset to only include chocolate candies
fruit.win <- fruit.candy$winpercent
# extracts the winpercent values for chocolate candies
mean(fruit.win)
```

    [1] 44.11974

``` r
# this calculates the average winpercent f  or chocolate candies
```

``` r
candy |>
  group_by(chocolate) |>
  # group_by() splits the data into groups (such as chocolate versus non 
# chocolate)
  summarise(avg_win = mean(winpercent))
```

    # A tibble: 2 × 2
      chocolate avg_win
          <int>   <dbl>
    1         0    42.1
    2         1    60.9

``` r
# summarise() calculates a summary statistic (mean winpercent) for each group
```

On average, chocolate candy is ranked higher than fruit candy, as
candies containing chocolate have a higher mean winpercent.

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

``` r
t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
```


        Welch Two Sample t-test

    data:  choc.win and fruit.win
    t = 6.2582, df = 68.882, p-value = 2.871e-08
    alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
    95 percent confidence interval:
     11.44563 22.15795
    sample estimates:
    mean of x mean of y 
     60.92153  44.11974 

Yes, the difference is statistically significant since the p-value,
2.871e-08, from the t-test is less than 0.05. This suggests that the
difference in average winpercent between chocolate candies and fruity
candies is unlikely to be due to chance.

            winpercent
    Sixlets     34.722

Sixlets is the worst ranked chocolate candy.

Starburst is the best ranked fruity candy.

## Taking a look at pricepercent

Make a plot of winpercent vs pricepercent

``` r
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent,
      pricepercent,
      label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) +
  geom_text()
```

![](class09_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png)

We can fix the label text overplotting with an add-on package called
**ggrepel** and it’s `geom_text_repel()`

``` r
library (ggrepel)
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent,
      pricepercent,
      label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) +
  geom_text_repel(col=mycols, max.overlaps = 5)
```

![](class09_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png)

``` r
# geom_text_repel() adds labels to points while preventing overlapping text

The Reese’s Minature is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for
the least money.

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and
> of these which is the least popular?

``` r
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)

```

                             pricepercent winpercent
    Nik L Nip                       0.976   22.44534

    Hershey's Milk Chocolate        0.918   56.49050

The top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset are Nik L Nip,
Nestle Smarties, Ring pop, Hershey’s Krackel, and Hershey’s Milk
Chocolate. The least popular is Nik L Nip since it has the lowest

# direction
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated
> (i.e. have minus values)?

The two variables “Chocolate” and “Fruity” are anti-correlated because
they have red values for each other.

> Q23. Use your corrplot result to make a prediction: which variables do
> you expect will have the largest contributions (i.e. loadings) to PC1
> (i.e., drive the most separation between candies along the first
> principal component)?

I expect chocolate and bar to have large positive contributions to PC1,
while fruity will have a large negative contribution since chocolate and
bar are strongly positively correlated, while fruity is strongly
anti-correlated with chocolate. Additionally, variables like
pricepercent and winpercent could also contribute to PC1 since they show
positive relationships with chocolate. Hence, this suggests that PC1
will mainly separate chocolate-based candies from fruity candies as a
result.

I expect fruity, chocolate and bar candies to have the largest
contributions to PC1 since chocolate and bar should load together seeing
as they are positively correlated. In comparison, fruity should load in
the opposite direction since fruity and chocolate are anti-correlated.
Overall, this suggests that PC1 will separate chocoalate bar candies
from fruity candies. \## Principal Component Analysis

In this case we want to be sure to set `scale=TRUE` argument for
`prcomp()` because we have one variable `winpercent` that is on a very
different scale than all others and would otherwise dominant our PCA
results.

pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)

First major result figure is tghe “score plot” of PC1 vs PC2 - how the
different candy are related to each other on our new PC axis:

``` r
ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=row.names(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) +
  geom_text_repel(col=mycols)
```

```

The variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction as
this includes fruity, pluribus, and hard since they have large positive
loading values. In contrast, variables such as chocolate, bar,
winpercent, and pricepercent have strong negative loadings on PC1. This
makes sense since chocolate and bar candies tend to be grouped together
and are opposite in characteristics to fruity candies. Moreover, the
plot displays candies are either chocolate-based or fruity, but not
both. This relationship was highlighted previously in the correlation
matrix of the corrplot, where chocolate and fruity were strongly
anti-correlated while chocolate and bar were positively correlated.

The “winning” candy seems to be chocolate-based, often a bar, and
associated with higher winpercent and pricepercent values. The
visualizations also show that many of the highest ranked candies were
chocolate candies, while fruity candies tended to rank lower overall.
Additionally, the correlation plot shows that chocolate was positively
related to popularity and that chocolate and fruity were
anti-correlated. Furthermore, the PCA supported this by separating
chocolate and bar candies from fruity candies along PC1. Hence, this
suggests that chocolate based candies such as candy bars, tend to be
more popular in this dataset as a result.
